Notes from the prototypers:

Stall until sufficient USD instead of breaking with an error code, or seperate the load USD functionality from the /execute buy and send crypto endpoint.

Optimize delay on how quickly we cancel a purchase order.

Protect endpoints with OAuth/some other security. We want our own services calling them AFTER debiting the appropriate amounts from client accounts, not some other arbitrary person getting free crypto orders on our dime.

Investigate any issues caused by already having some BTC/ETH... in account while trying to purchase.

Make sure we're getting the right error on the output part of the payroll transaction, I believe we want the one that says it sent to coinbase temporarily (I think it's a guard GDAX has in their sandbox code to prevent real-currency withdrawals)

Change the GDAX sandbox URL to production.

Generate API keys on the GDAX mainnet for production.

Make sure the file with API keys is penetration-proof.

Verify that we can deposit from a valid wire or ACH payment mechanism on the mainnet. (whichever is needed)
